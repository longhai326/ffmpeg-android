# ffmpeg-android

* FFmpeg for Android with x264 and lame options

Supported android ABI's
----
* armeabi*
* armeabi-v7a
* arm64-v8a
* x86
* x86_64
* mips*
* mips64*

Note: *-Deprecated in android NDK r16. Will be removed in r17
see https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis.html#Supported ABIs

Instructions
----
* Set environment ANDROID_NDK variable e.g. /opt/android/android-ndk-r16b
  1. export ANDROID_NDK={Android NDK Base Path}
* NDK verification status (build with clang/clang++ and API-21 unless otherwise specified):
  1. x264: ndk-r16b, ndk-r15c (build all; but arm64-v8a libx.a has own undefined references e.g. x264_8_... x264_10...)
  2. libvpx-1.7.0: ndk-r15c (build all except mips and mips64; ndk-r16b built has errors - see vpx_build.sh);
  configure with Target=arm64-android-gcc has error which uses incorrect cc i.e. arm-linux-androideabi-gcc;
  3. lame-3.100: ndk-r16b, ndk-r15c (build all)
  4. ffmpeg ndk-r16b, ndk-r15c (build all)
  5. clang support needs min ndk-r12c, but may not neccessary works for all ABIS (64-bit built has problem)
  6. Change setttins.sh with clang=>gcc and clang++=>g++ if you need lower ndk version
* To fetch and update submodules and libraries; use ./init_update_libs.sh command
  1. ./init_update_libs.sh
  2. edit the ./init_update_libs.sh files for your desired module version
* Run either one of the following commands to compile ffmpeg for all or one the supported ABI's
  1. ./ffmpeg-android_build.sh
  2. ./ffmpeg-android_build.sh armeabi-v7a (example)
  3. As #1 but create custom settings.sh#ABIS=("armeabi" "armeabi-v7a" "arm64-v8a" "mips" "mips64" "x86" "x86_64") for your project
* To support 64bit libraries built, change settings.sh#ANDROID_API=21; min API for 64-bit library build.
* All the generated static libraries and includes are in ./build/ffmpeg/android/<ABI> directory.

Help:
-------
* Set up Linux/Ubuntu development environment with the below build tools
  1. sudo apt-get --quiet --yes install build-essential git autoconf libtool pkg-config gperf gettext yasm python-lxml

* Patches for Sub-module
  1. ./ffmpeg-android_build.sh includes the patches for the sub-modules 
  2. ffmpeg-android_patch.sh applies patches to the relevant sub-module with patch files from ./pathes directory
  3. edit these files to include additional patches if required.

* x264.a generated for arm64-v8a has undefined references to its own *.o files e.g. x264_8_... x264_10... Seems to be x264 configure problem.

Note:
-------
Both the android NDK, ffmpeg and its sub-modules are in continous update, it is likely that
some of the defined ABI's settings may need to be tweaked as submodule configure have new changes.
